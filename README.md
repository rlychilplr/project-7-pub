## Running the game

extract `card_game_dump.7z` to where your mysql/mariadb saves the database

Windows Xampp
```
C:\xampp\mysql\data\
```

Linux Xampp (probably the same for macos)
```
/opt/lampp/var/mysql/
```

look in the database for the usernames of users already created. the password for all users is:
```
Passw0rd!
```

just throw the `src` folder wherever your host expects it (i.e. `C:\xampp\htdocs`, `/opt/lampp/htdocs`, `/srv/http`, etc.)
